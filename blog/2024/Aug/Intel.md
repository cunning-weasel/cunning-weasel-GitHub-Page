## Intel, It's Time for a Radical Shift

I think it's time someone asks the hard questions. Ok, many people I know, respect and admire have been asking these questions, but in light of the recent meltdown (pun intended) Intel has had, I think it's time we start having this conversation again. 

So, to my dearest imaginary Intel reader, as this one's for you, let's recap:

1. CPU Race: During the AMD Bulldozer days, Intel was undeniably ahead. But with the rise of AMD's Zen architecture, it feels like Intel has slipped into the position AMD once occupied — steadfastly and securely in second place (read: last option). Your disregard for multi-threading back then has come back to footgun you, and the powdery residue shows.

2. GPU Ventures: You ventured into the GPU space and, frankly, fell flat. In the race against NVIDIA and AMD, you’re not just trailing; you're so far behind that it's questionable if you even took part in the race.

3. Security Vulnerabilities: Yes, both Intel and AMD have been hit with security vulnerabilities, but given the state of your CPU and GPU divisions, Intel is struggling to absorb these hits in the same way AMD can. 

4. Recent CPU Issues: The recent debacle with CPU issues — denied until they were ignored into existence — further erodes trust. You’re digging yourselves deeper, and it's painful to watch.

Now, I implore you, Intel: PLEASE—for the sake of your legacy and the tech community — change your course, or you'll be ignored right into bankrupcy.

Nobody wants your current CPUs or GPUs. Your brand has lost enough trust that a return to former glory seems unlikely unless you take drastic action. This is your chance to reinvent yourselves. Go back to your roots with SoCs (System on Chips) and do it right. Here’s why:

1. Disrupt the OS Space: A unified, powerful SoC could drastically simplify the OS landscape. Imagine a 10,000-line OS running on your SoC, transparent and open to developers. We could even develop our own OSs like the boot disk-days - the positions you took in 80s and 90s is what got you to where you are. Maybe we need a little old school again. 

2. Enhance Security: A well-designed SoC would reduce the attack surface for bad actors. With more transparency, you'd have a global army of developers helping to find and fix vulnerabilities. Simply eliminating millions of lines of unnecessary code between developers and the hardware would drastically reduce security risks.

3. Dominate the Market: By leading the charge in SoC development, you could outpace competitors like Raspberry Pi and be a disruptive force in the market before they catch up.

4. Compete in Gaming: A truly competitive SoC could give the console gaming market a run for its money, offering an alternative that's both powerful and developer-friendly. What steam boxes should have been. 

This might be the radical shift you need. 

Note: for transparency, this is similar to a post I posted on the Intel sub-reddit (which, of course, got promptly removed).
