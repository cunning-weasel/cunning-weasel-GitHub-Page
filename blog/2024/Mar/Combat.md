## Strangely, the older I get, the more combat sport appeals to me and it's kinda weird

I've always been caught in a weird place where I've been pulled into sports - mostly because I'm naturally good at them. A 1.95m wingspan and a *natural (read African)* ability to run fast and jump high. 

So I always got pulled and pushed into sports. Everything from swimming to rugby, atheletics, basketball, football and even some stranger sports that I had no business being a part of like tennis and squash. 

So it'll be as much of a surprize to you as it is to me, dear reader, that I actually never particularly liked any of those sports except basketball and atheletics - and specifically, 100m sprints, long jump and high jump. 
My family and friends were both unsurprised and slightly surprised at the fact that I've started to dig in even more to combat sports. My poison of choice being boxing and BJJ. 

What makes all of this even stranger is that Zimbabwe, as well as The Netherlands, are huge football loving nations. In fact, I'd wager that my association with these 2 countires lumps me into the football fan category by default. 
And so, in my teenage years, I supported Barcelona FC. How could I possibly show my face in bars, pubs and cafes if I didn't even have a passing notion of who messi was or what the hell a ronaldinho is.  

How could I possibly join in discussion around player trades, coaches, strategies - you name it - without having some idea of what was happening in that world? 

The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, I lied. 

I've never been a big football fan, I find the sport ludicrously boring and I find it's player to be among the world biggest.... erm.... pussy-cats. 

They perpetually whinge and cry, which I'm afraid has sadly infiltrated the great bastion of the Nba, and basketball as a whole. 
Players flail around and cry at every touch they recieve from opposing players. 
Many joke, and I will contend that, nowadays, you can get hit with a foul for passing gas. 

And that's an absolute far-cry from the Nba of Mike, Magic, AI and those boys. Those days were ruthless. PLayers were out to slit your throat on their best days, and on their worst days they were gunning for you with the intent to physically punish you as hard as they possibly could, dashing any thoughts you'd have in the future of putting your head down and driving to the hole. 

That attitude of never backing down, always getting up after being knocked down. Striving for the beef. Wanting *that smoke*. 

Sports to me nowadays is the polar opposite of the above. People talk about 'good sportmanship' and 'being a good role model' as if it's the players' responsibility to instill good morals in your children. 

And so to anyone who's as jaded and tired of the continued soap operas that are sports nowadays, have no fear. Combat sports are one of the last places where you *won't* find political correct-ness, nice-ness, koombaya - type non-sense. 

Grown men and women step into the squared circle or octagon and anything they said before or after - they're accountable for. Wanna chat trash about your opponent? All good, just hope your bite matches your bark. 

Fighters compete to win, are ruthless in their persuit of it, and absoutely do not pander to however the world is feeling about subject x or y today, tomorrow or ever. 

I used to think that rugby players, Nfl, Nhl - I thought these were tough sports. And while they are a tough (wom)mans contact sport, it's still one that you *play*. 

As a fighter myself, I can guarantee you - you *don't play* fighting. Give it a try. And if you fancy getting beat-up by a nerd - give me a shout! ;)
