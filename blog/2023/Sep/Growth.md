## Why not: Jack of all trades, Master of one, or two, or three, maybe four? Maybe more?

I'm not sure where this mentality developed from, or who has been pushing its narrative over the years, but want to address this once and for all in the article.

Since time in memorium, the idea that someone, or something tends to be a "jack of all trades, master or none" has been a mentality I've had to deal with for years. And we often just accept it, like life really is that binary.

I can remember the first instance I experienced something along those lines, at least professionally. I studied tourism management and consultancy. Unlike every other student at the time, I opted to go into hotels as a first stop in the working-world of adulthood.
What surprised me is how many people were shocked by this.
"Wait, you studied tourism, **_and don't_** want to work for an airline or a destination marketing company!?"

Since the last 2 years of being a freelancer, it's a box I'm often placed into - or at the very least peer into, as I take on new contracts and clients.
Yes, I'm a developer (mostly web, but other things time and again).
Yes, I am a marketer (I prefer the term growth hacker but I digress).
Yes, I am a business developer and account executive.
I **_can_** do all of the above for you. No, I don't only have to do one, and if I work with a client who wants to do just one - that's abosutely fine.

Where my issue of contention comes into play here has to do with general management and strategy around this. Of course we know that you're looking to have a specialized team of marketers, or developers when you hire for marketing or dev roles. I'm not making to references to those cases. When you as a business owner deem it necessary, for your business strategy, to employ people to do specific things - that's your call, and you know best how to navigate that. 

But on the other end of the spectrum, you have management who deem swiss-army knives can do all tasks they are qualified to do, but in the same time and at the same velocity as it would take 2 or 3 specialists at their individual roles.

I wish it wasn't so binary. To quote Chat Holmes' brilliant book The Ultimate Sales Machine:

>> ... there are three types of executives. A full 90% are what I call 'tactical executives', while 9% are 'strategic'. 
>
>> ... tactical executives don't understand strategy. If you tell them that it's twice as hard today as it was 10 years ago to get an appointment with a with a prospect, they will think of ways to make the sales team work twice as hard. 
>
>> ... and only 1% - the most effective executives - possess the rare combintation of both tactical and strategic abilities.

I strive to be the executive that posses the rare combination of both, and let's for once and all understand that going the 'jack of all trades, master of none' approach, as opposed to the 'master of one, or two....', is more a strategic and tactical choice on the business level, rather than it is one based on the competence of the individual contributor.
