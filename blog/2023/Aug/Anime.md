## Anime is a cool thing and this is why

It's one of the few arts where there's a convergence of nearly all things I like, packed into a colorful knock-out punch that looks as cute as Pikachu, but hits like iron-Mike in his prime.

I never started to think about it until recently, but anime, for me and many others, serves as a divergent point at which tech, style and swagger, nostalgia and just-cool-things are crammed into Japanese-inspired story-telling, visuals, music and even culture.
